//Summary of JavaScript Array Methods https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp
1. **Array Length**:
   - **Explanation**: Think of a bookshelf where you can count the number of books. The `length` of an array is similar; it tells you how many items are in your list.
   - **Example**: Imagine a shopping list with items like milk, bread, and eggs. The length of the list is the number of items you need to buy.

2. **toString()**:
   - **Explanation**: If you have a box of toys and you're listing them out loud one after another, that's similar to how `toString()` works. It converts your list of items into a single, nicely formatted string.
   - **Example**: You have a collection of favorite movies. When you name each movie one by one, it's like turning that list into a sentence.

3. **Popping and Pushing**:
   - **Explanation**:
     - `pop()`: Picture removing the very last toy from a box—it's taking out the item at the end of your list.
     - `push()`: Adding a new toy to the end of your collection—it's like putting something at the back of your list.
   - **Example**: In your collection of trading cards, taking out the last card is like using `pop()`. Adding a new card to the end is similar to `push()`.

4. **Shifting and Unshifting**:
   - **Explanation**:
     - `shift()`: Similar to removing the first toy from your box—it's taking out the first item in your list.
     - `unshift()`: Adding a new toy to the beginning—it's like putting a toy at the start of your collection.
   - **Example**: Imagine a set of keys. Removing the first key is like using `shift()`. Adding a new key to the set is similar to `unshift()`.

5. **Changing Elements**:
   - **Explanation**: It's like rearranging your toys in a specific order or changing one toy for another in your collection.
   - **Example**: You have a set of favorite superhero toys. If you decide to replace one hero with another, that's changing an element in your collection.

6. **Delete**:
   - **Explanation**: It's like taking a toy out of your box completely, but be aware, it might leave an empty space.
   - **Example**: In your collection of stickers, if you decide to remove one entirely, that's similar to using `delete`.

7. **Merging Arrays**:
   - **Explanation**: Picture combining two boxes of toys into a bigger box—it's making a larger collection by merging.
   - **Example**: Combining two separate lists of chores into one single list is akin to using `concat()`.

8. **Flattening Arrays**:
   - **Explanation**: If you have a box with smaller boxes inside, making it all one layer is like simplifying or reducing the layers in your collection.
   - **Example**: Think of nesting dolls where you take them all out of each other to make a single row—it's like `flat()`.

9. **Splicing and Slicing**:
   - **Explanation**:
     - `splice()`: Adding or removing specific items at certain places in your list.
     - `slice()`: Taking out a portion of your collection to make a new one without altering the original.
   - **Example**: In a collection of clothes, if you remove or add items at a specific spot, that's like `splice()`. Taking a selection of clothes without changing the original bunch is similar to `slice()`.

10. **Automatic toString()**:
    - **Explanation**: When you're talking about your collection, sometimes it naturally turns into words or a list with commas in between items.
    - **Example**: Explaining your favorite board games naturally becomes a list of names without any extra effort—similar to automatic `toString()`.

11. **Max and Min Values**:
    - **Explanation**: Sadly, there's no simple way to directly find the largest or smallest item in your collection. You have to search manually.
    - **Example**: In a collection of coins, finding the rarest or the most common coin requires manually checking each one.
